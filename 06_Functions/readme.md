# Functions

1. A function is a block of JavaScript code that is defined once but may be executed any number of times.

2. Function declaration consists of

- the function keyword
- the name of the function
- a list of parameters to the function
- the JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.

3. Function expressions look like function declarations, but they appear within the context of a larger expression or statement, and the name is optional. However, a name can be provided with a function expression.

4. function parameters

- Primitive parameters are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.
- Object parameter are passed to function and the function changes the object's properties, that change is visible outside the function.
