## Data Types

## Six Primitive Data Types: number, string, boolean, bigint, undefined, symbol

1. undefined: typeof "undefined" uninitialized variable (undefined), by default any uninitialized variable gets the value of undefined
2. boolean: typeof "boolean" (true|false)
3. number: typeof "number" (including integer and floating point numbers between pow(-2, 53) to pow(2,53) -1 )
4. string: typeof "string"(immutable, index start at 0, having methods)
5. bigint: typeof "bigint" (large number, appending 'n' to the end of and integer)
6. symbol: typeof "symbol" (guaranteed unique identifies for object properties and immutable)

## Object and Function Data Types

1. null: typeof "object" is a special primitive type (null) for an empty object pointer
2. Object: typeof "object" is a structural type
3. Function: typeof "function" in a non-data structure

\*\*The "typeof" operator is an operator that returns a string containing the type of the operand.
